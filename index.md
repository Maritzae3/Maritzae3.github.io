### CPSC 120
 
 * Lab 1
  
    My first favorite lab was Lab 01, part 1. This is one of my favorite labs because it was the first-ever lab to teach me the basics and how GitHub works. Ever since the teachings of Lab 01, I have felt confident in coding, and since then, I have developed my skills.

* Lab 7

    Another favorite lab of mine is Lab 07, part 2. This is one of my favorite labs because it is involved with poker, and poker is one of my favorite card games to play with my family. Typically, getting involved with something I love to do makes things more fun and interesting for me, which makes it a fun learning experience overall.
  
* Lab 12

    Finally, there is Lab 12. Lab 12 is considered one of my favorites because it is involved with pictures, gifs, and animations. I love gifs and animations. I have always wondered how they operate, and I finally now get to understand how it operates personally, which honestly seems so fascinating to me on how pixels move around crazily.
